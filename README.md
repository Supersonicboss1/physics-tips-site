# TODO
- [ ] Make site subject-agnostic
- [ ] While the tags system *works,* it is too generic of a solution. Re-engineer the system to have things such as subject or category not parts of the tags system to allow better filtering and separation of data.
- [ ] For links with no subject/tag, always show unless checkbox ticked/unticked
- [x] ~~The two pages are way too similar, there must be a way to abstract that.~~ just remove one I guess?
- [x] ~~The name is getting a bit unwieldy, maybe change that?~~ leave it for now, think about a better name if this gets near completion.
